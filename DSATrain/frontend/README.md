## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for modern, responsive design
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Recharts** for data visualization

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Backend API server running on http://localhost:8000

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_SKILL_TREE_URL=http://localhost:8002
```

## API Integration

The frontend connects to the FastAPI backend through the `apiService` which provides:

- **Problem Management**: Browse, search, and filter problems
- **ML Recommendations**: Get personalized suggestions
- **User Tracking**: Record interactions for ML training
- **Analytics**: Access user behavior and platform trends
- **Learning Paths**: Generate and manage study plans (`/learning-paths/*`)
- **Practice**: Sessions, attempts, elaborative logging, working-memory checks (`/practice/*`)
- **Interview**: Start/complete interview sessions (`/interview/*`)
- **Cognitive**: Profile, assessment, and UI adaptation (`/cognitive/*`)

For a full list of backend endpoints and methods, see `../docs/API_REFERENCE.md`.

## Contributing

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Use Material-UI components consistently
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add loading states for API calls
5. Ensure responsive design principles

## Integration with Backend

The frontend automatically adapts to backend availability:
- Shows connection status in the header
- Graceful degradation when API is offline
- Error messages with actionable guidance
- Automatic retry mechanisms

This frontend provides a modern, intuitive interface for the ML-powered DSA training platform, making advanced recommendation algorithms accessible through a user-friendly web interface.
